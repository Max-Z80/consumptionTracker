# Use cases

#### UC 1.1
Fred tries to reduce his water consumption. He has written regularly on the app the water meter reading, and writes notes about his actions in the app. Today is a special day, because he will write the latest reading and check whether his latest action (written in the latest note) had an effect on his consumption. After adding the reading, he looks at the graph and sees that his consumption has reduced. He concludes that his action (as visible by the timestamped note ) enabled to reduce his consumption.

####Â UC 2.1
Fred tracks water consumption at home. He needs to add a note at the date of today. He does not need to provide a m3 reading (as he did last month). He clicks to see the form and enters his note. He saves. The graph is updated and displays the note on the time axis.

#### UC 2.2
Yesterday Fred decided to reduce the time he spends under the shower to 10min. He wants to write it down today to the app because he did not have the time to write it yesterday. He clicks to open the form, set the date to yesterday and writes the note. He saves. The graph is updated and displays the note on the time axis.

#### UC 3.1
Fred has just added a note but realised that he made a typo. He clicks on the note on the graph, fixes the typo, saves. The graph is updated.
